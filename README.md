## 🛠 Setup Instructions

### 1. Set your Web App URL

Update the base URL of your web application so that the native client knows where to load content from.

#### 🔧 `AppDelegate.swift`

Find this line:

```swift
let remotePathConfigURL = URL(string: "http://localhost:5000/configurations/ios.json")!
```

Replace it with your actual URL:

```swift
let remotePathConfigURL = URL(string: "https://your-app.com")!
```

#### 🔧 `SceneDelegate.swift`

Do the same:

```swift
let rootURL = URL(string: "https://your-app.com")!
```
